                <p>Welcome aboard my blog! </p>

                <p>
                    The name of the blog was inspired by an excellent talk, called <a
                        href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/strategic-design-imperfection">Strategic Design:
                    Embrace Imperfection!</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/ericevans0">Eric Evans</a>. For those who
                    don’t know Eric, he wrote <a
                        href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Domain-driven-Design-Tackling-Complexity-Software/dp/0321125215">Domain-Driven
                    Design: Tackling Complexity in the Heart of Software</a> one of the most influential books in the
                    software community. The book discusses the need to promote <b>business focused software design</b>
                    rather than just technology.

                    At the end of the talk, he explained that during a recent project he had worked on, the team
                    designed an <em>elegant model</em> that dealt with 90% of the cases. Moreover, another 5% could
                    be
                    resolved by extending or modifying the model. However, this left a remaining 5% to resolve. They
                    decided to
                    adopt the old way of making software: if-else conditions and the procedural paradigm. It sounds like
                    a
                    very familiar situation to me and it reminds me of a very funny film: <a
                        href="http://www.filmaffinity.com/en/film245798.html">Groundhog Day</a>.

                <p>
                    One of the things that springs to mind when I think about this situation is that in the software
                    community I have found this <i>“purity”</i> mentality exists in many paradigms, platforms, etc.
                    Such an attitude is creating a lot of <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?HolyWar">holy wars</a> (e.g.
                    <a href="http://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2014/11/24/FPvsOO.html">OO vs FP</a>). From my point
                    of view in the search for <i>“purity”</i> adopting diverse paradigms and approaches is overlooked.
                    However,
                    applying diversity to problem solving can provide a lot of benefits.

                    As Evans mentioned one of the benefits was to <strong>deliver the software to production
                    earlier</strong> than anticipated. Another interesting outcome was that if in the future they found
                    a way to modify their design to incorporate the remaining exceptions, they would able to do it
                    immediately. On the other
                    hand, if they never find the opportunity, this would mean that it is probably not very important.
                    Therefore from this perspective you are <strong>eliminating waste</strong> and <strong>focusing on
                    value</strong>. In addition to this, you are <strong>avoiding procrastination</strong>. I have seen
                    people who are very focus on <em>perfect design</em>. This hinders progress, leading to <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_paralysis"><strong>analysis paralysis</strong></a>.

                    <em>Perfection</em> in software design is a <i>subjective concept</i>, it depends on the
                    <i>purpose of the software</i> that you are designing. For me the important thing when you
                    are designing is to <strong>establish objectives</strong>, <strong>act upon the current
                    information</strong> and <strong>learn from the process</strong> to improve it later if need be.
                    In other words, we should strive for <a
                        href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continual_improvement_process"><strong>Continuous
                    improvement</strong></a>.
                </p>

                <p>
                    I know that most of these ideas already exist in the software development community, but my advice
                    is to adopt them as a personal attitude so we are conscious of our decisions. <strong>How long
                    before
                    you Embrace the imperfection!</strong>
